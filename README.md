# Paradox Thief 
About The Project: At the beginning of our brainstorming process, we explored a wide range of ideas for possible games. Ultimately, Paradox Thief became our top choice because we felt it captured the theme of time travel in a unique and creative way.

In Paradox Thief, you play as a clever thief who steals a dangerous invention called the Rift Paradox Machine, a device that allows you to travel through time. However, things quickly spiral out of control. Now, you’re being pursued by the Time Police Ghost Force for stealing an illegal artifact. All you wanted was to return to your original timeline, but instead, you’re forced to run, hide, and survive. Along the way, you’ll face clever puzzles and dodge hazardous traps like sharp spikes and high-powered lasers and a plot twist at the end. If you get caught or hit, you have to start over!

What sets this game apart is the time-travel mechanic. When you go back in time, only your character is affected, not the world around you. And here's the twist: traveling back in time makes you younger. That means your character literally shrinks! You can now squeeze into tight spaces, but there’s a trade-off. Being smaller makes it harder to jump high or reach certain areas. This forces players to think strategically about when to use their time powers. Sometimes size and strength matter, and other times agility and small size offer the best solution.

We built the game using Unity. We started by designing the basic player controls, movement and jumping. Then we implemented the time-travel mechanics, shrinking ability, and enemies. One of the most challenging aspects was getting the ghost enemies and time mechanics to work correctly. Things didn’t always go smoothly, features broke and bugs popped up, but through testing, debugging, and teamwork, we were able to solve the problems.

We're especially proud of how the time-travel feature enhances gameplay and adds a fun layer of complexity. The story and mechanics complement each other well, making the experience more immersive. Throughout this project, we learned valuable skills such as collaboration, troubleshooting, and game design.

Next, we plan to expand the game with new levels and exciting boss fights, intense battles with powerful enemies! Eventually, we hope to publish Paradox Thief online so more people can enjoy playing it.

Creating Paradox Thief was a fun and rewarding experience. We’re proud of what we built and hope others enjoy the challenge and creativity that went into it!
